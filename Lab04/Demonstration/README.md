# Exercise

## Task 1
Change the code to compute the accuracy of the model for each training epoch. Also evaluate the model on the test set after each training epoch.

## Task 2
Transform the current implementation into one that trains a regression model with only 1 output neuron. Change/Add code as you see fit.

## Task 3
Transform the current implementation into a binary classification one with 1 or 2 outputs. It should classify the wine as either "Good" (Quaility 7 and 8) or "Bad" (the other quality values). Change/Add code as you see fit.

Hint: Be careful with what output activation function, loss function and label transformation you use.
