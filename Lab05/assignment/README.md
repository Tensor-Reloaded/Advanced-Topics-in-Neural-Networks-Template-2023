- implemented logging system using Tensorboard
- used weights & biases to hyper-tune the parameters: best accuracy obtained - 0.42 on SGD with learning_rate = 0.09 and batch size = 128
- evaluated the performance of SGD, Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad on multiple configurations each
- plotted a graph for each optimizer and one with the best results
