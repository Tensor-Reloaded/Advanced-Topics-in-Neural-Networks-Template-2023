## Assigment 5

I logged all the hyperparameters and results in the tensorboard and I uploaded a folder with the logs.

I used weight and biases to hypertune my parameters until the google colab disconnected me from the gpu. Link to wandb: https://wandb.ai/vlapin/image-classification/overview?workspace=user-vlapin

I run 3 different configuration for every optimizer that is listed in the assigment and the result are in the weight and biases and tensorboard logs. The best result was with the sgd optimizer with sam that had 0.51 on validation accuracy. I also uploaded a .svg file with the validation accuracy of the configurations that I have tried. 

Expected points: 7
