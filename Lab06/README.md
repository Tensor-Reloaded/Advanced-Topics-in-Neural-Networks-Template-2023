What was done:
1. Added logging using Tensorboard - 1p
2. Used weights and biases - 1p. Link: https://wandb.ai/uaics/advanced_topics_lab6?workspace=user-george-smoc13
3. Obtained an accuracy higher than 40%: 

I tried to maximize the accuracy by forcing the model to learn using layers with small sizes
