# [Advanced Topics in Neural Networks Template 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/atnn)

Repository for the Advanced Topics in Neural Networks laboratory, "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University, Faculty of Computer Science, Master degree.


## How to use

1. Fork the repository.
2. Upload the assignments and homeworks in their corresponding "Lab`X`/Solution" directory of your fork.
3. Check the course website and Github Repository at least once a week. Read the updates to the README files as they contain important information regarding helpful resources and assignments.
4. Sync your personal fork whenever changes appear in the upstream repository.

## Environment setup

PyTorch, Pandas, Numpy, Tensorboard, Matplotlib, and Opencv are already available in Google Colab.

Local installation: 
1. Create a Python virtual environment (the current stable version for ~~PyTorch 2.0.1 is Python 3.10~~ PyTorch 2.1 is Python 3.11).
    * If you are using `conda`, use `conda config --add channels conda-forge` first to add `conda-forge` as your highest priority channel.
3. Activate the virtual environment and install PyTorch from [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) using `conda` or `pip`, depending on your environment.
    * Choose the Stable Release, choose your OS, select Conda or Pip and your compute platform. For Linux and Windows, CUDA 1X.X or CPU builds are available, while for Mac, only builds with CPU and MPS acceleration.
    * Example CPU: ```conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch```.
4. Install Tensorboard.
    * `conda install -c conda-forge tensorboard` / `pip install tensorboard`.
5. Install Matplotlib.
    * `conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib` / `pip install matplotlib`.
6. Install Opencv.
    * `conda install -c conda-forge opencv` / `pip install opencv-python`.
